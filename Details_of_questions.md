## Data Project - SQL Version

Solve the IPL data problem, but this time with SQL, using PostgreSQL database.

#### 1. Create DB, permissions etc.
Write a SQL script that creates a new user, and database. Make the user the owner of the db.

#### 2. Clean up script
Write another SQL script that cleans up the user, and database created in the previous step.

#### 3. Load CSV
Write a SQL script that loads CSV data into a table.

#### 4. Solve the IPL problems
In a SQL file write queries that will solve the problems of the IPL data set, but this time with SQL. You can copy paste the queries in a .sql file and submit.

**Note:** the result in this case is not a graph but SQL Result Set.
